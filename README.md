DOLBY DIGITAL BROADCASTING OF MUSIC AND PODCASTS VIA UNICAST PROTOCOL

(Demo example windows app and .Net component for listening to music from the popular Atlas.Music service)

The service broadcasts original music using the UNICAST protocol, which allows you to listen to music of your choice.
The Atlas.Music music library contains a large amount of musical material for different preferences.
The service actively uses elements of machine learning, which makes music selection more convenient and more accurate.
At the moment, several applications have already been developed for Android devices that provide listening to music on smartphones and home theaters.
An important feature of the service is that it broadcasts music in the Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 surround format without conversion.
You can listen to this music format on devices with multi-channel audio output.
The component described here allows you to embed the functionality of the Atlas.Music service into your applications for free.
However, the ability to listen to music in surround format is disabled in the free version.

If you have any questions or would like to help in the development of this project, please email to atlas.callback@gmail.com

P.S. For the component to work, you must have an installed last version of the VLC player (videolan.org) with a plugin registered.
